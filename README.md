# rock-paper-scissors

Took me 2 days. And it took me a while to figure out step 6. Had to research a lot and understand for loops.

Definitely improved my problem solving and management skills. I had to write down the steps so that it would be clearer for me and I wouldn't get overwhelmed. 

Looking forward to more challenging projects such as this.
